<h2>Struggles</h2>
<p>Immigrants are part of the future of America, but face many problems that need to be addressed.</p>
<button class="accordion">Safety and sanctuary</button>
<div class="drop">
  <p>New immigrants are not necessarily safe when they enter the country. They may not know what to do if they enter the country illegally and need guidance and housing. As a country, we are responsible of helping immigrants set their feet on the right path.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Basic human rights</button>
<div class="drop">
  <p>All humans needs: food, water shelter, and clothing. Illegal immigrants are humans and they need these rights as well. We are a responsible as a nation for providing these necessities to all immigrants.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Security and family</button>
<div class="drop">
  <p>Many immigrants are separated from their families at the border. They should have a right to be united with their family and be protected.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Social and lingual integration</button>
<div class="drop">
  <p>Immigrants are not able to integrate with society because they don't fully understand how our country works and may not be able to speak English. They are more suspectible to scams as well.</p>
</div>

<h2>Tennessee Laws</h2>
<p>HB2312 and HB2315 are extreme anti-immigrant laws passed by Tenneessee legislature in 2023. These laws should be modified to be less harsh on immigrants.</p>
<ul>
  <li>HB 2315 would mandate the detention of immigrants based on requests from federal immigration agents without warrants.</li>
  <li>HB 2312 would ban the acceptance of consular IDs (given by foreign countries for people living abroad) to access government services.</li>
</ul>
<p><mark>Having access to government services is important for human rights, and they should be available regardless of citizenship status. As a party that supports the inalienable rights that our country has to offer, we should allow these rights to be accessible even to illegal immigrants. If you do not do this, you would attract scorn from many of your fringe supporters, who make up a large portion of your voting base. We can still act against illegal immigration in a way that is respectful of the rights and well-being of these people.</mark></p>
