    <h3>Top 6 Myths about Immigrants</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Immigrants will take American jobs and welfare<p><i><b>False.</b> Immigrants help create new jobs and generate
            more money to fuel our economy and welfare programs. Taxes paid by immigrants will offset any additional government expenditures.</i></p>
        <p><b>Why do we hold this belief?</b> We use immigrants as a scapegoat for our problems instead of realizing
          what they do for our nation and identifying our own faults.</p>
      </li>
      <li>It is easy to immigrate here legally because we are the most lenient nation<p><i><b>False.</b> The U.S. is one
            of the strictest countries for immigration out of most developed countries.</i></p>
            <p><b>Why do we hold this belief?</b> We see a lot of legal immigrants in our country and believe that they got into our country without putting any work. In reality, they had to get educated and go through a long process to get into the country.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Immigrants don’t assimilate as well today and bring bad culture with them<p><i><b>False.</b> Most immigrants
            are willing to adopt American values as long as their culture is respected. The biggest threat to our culture is social media and other factors that have nothing to do with immigration.</i></p>
            <p><b>Why do we hold this belief?</b> We fear that our culture will be spoiled by other cultures. It also comes with a certain stigma. We do not like seeing people to be different or we feel awkward or out of place.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Immigrants pose a unique risk today because of terrorism<p><i><b>False.</b> Terrorist attacks are extremely
            rare. We are more likely to die to other crimes and natural events..</i></p>
            <p><b>Why do we hold this belief?</b> 9/11, while a traumatic event, is a reason many people are afraid of certain types of immigrants. This leads to unnecessary action taken on a large group for the actions of an exteremely small percentage of immigrants. Most of these actions do not prevent any terrorist attacks, and there hasn't been a threat of one either.</p>
      </li>
      <li>We cannot handle an influx of immigrants as a nation<p><i><b>False.</b> Many Republicans claim that our
            country is facing a possible population crisis, so what is wrong with more people to help fix the
            problem?</i></p>
            <p><b>Why do we hold this belief?</b> We want the majority of resources in our country to go to people like us. We do not realize that we need more people in our country than ever.</p>
      </li>
      <li>More immigrants means Democrats will win more elections<p><i><b>False.</b> Many immigrants have traditional
            and conservative values. If supported, many of them would be willing to vote Republican. Currently, they
            feel alienated by the Republican party and therefore votes Democrat.</i></p>
            <p><b>Why do we hold this belief?</b> Immigrants are stereotyped to vote Democrat. This is false and many immigrants are willing to vote whichever side they feel is fit. Just like immigrants assume all Republicans to be racist, Republicans also assume all immigrants to be Democrat voters.</p>
          </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Immigrants help our nation in many ways. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2021/09/17/the-economic-benefits-of-extending-permanent-legal-status-to-unauthorized-immigrants/">Learn more here</a>.</p>
    <button class="accordion">Technology development</button>
    <div class="drop">
      <p>Many legal immigrants work in big companies and help create the technologies we use today.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Economic contribution</button>
    <div class="drop">
      <p>Immigrants provide significant labor output. They do the low wage jobs that we Americans would not do otherwise. Extended permanent legal status would allow us to generate more economic output that will support our nation.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Food production</button>
    <div class="drop">
      <p>Immigrant farmworkers make up an estimated 73% of agriculture workers in the United States. Nearly half of these workers are unauthorized.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Immigrants do not have to be a problem:</p>
    <button class="accordion">Drugs and human trafficking</button>
    <div class="drop">
      <p>Blocking immigration is not going to stop drugs from crossing the border. We can still help immigrants and stop drugs at the same time.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Poverty and homelessness</button>
    <div class="drop">
      <p>It is our responsibility to help our new potential citizens to get on the right foot. We should help all homeless including immigrant and non-immigrant. Instead, our backwards laws are forcing immigrants to become homeless.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Linguistic and cultural barriers</button>
    <div class="drop">
      <p>Bringing multilingual education to public schools is critical. English and American values should be taught to all immigrants.</p>
